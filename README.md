# HiwiApplicationTasks-Answers


## 1) Motivation

During my architecture study I have already worked as Hiwi for the ICD on RP 11/12 and it was an enriching and fun experience.
So I applied again initially for a Hiwi position and was relatively open in which area I find something because I bring in any case certain basic knowledge and can learn something new. I addition, since then I have deepened my studies in the direction of Digital Design and Fabrication as well as Computation (with the ICD Seminars, for example also the AAD Seminar with Zuardin and Prof. Wortmann) and my goal is to get accepted for the ITECH.

## 2) Self Assessment

How do you rate your Python and C# skills?

- basic knowledge of code structures and object oriented programming
- more experience in python than in C#
- actually 5 years ago when I actively did something in C++ and C# (during my electronical engineering/ information technologies study)
- I am no ITler, still an architect with an affinity to computation and computerization

## 3) Coding Tasks

1. Briefly explain the two code snippets you can find in this repo.

C# Code:
Sorts out keys with the values less than the "upperBound" (=10) of the Dictionary someDict and saves these keys into a new list with the name "someNewDict". It also calls a filling function with the "someDict" Dictionary before (that is not explained in the code snippet).

Python Code:
Reading json data from a list of files, sorting the keys by the attribute "time" in ascending order (I guess the time is the timestamp of the file).
This sorting process is done for every file in the filelist.

Additional task, not required:

2. Please implement a "named pipe" for exchanging double arrays between a C# and Python process.

Because the Python code is already reading json data I used the Json Serializer to save a list in the C# code as json file.
This is done in a sperate function that is called afterwards.
